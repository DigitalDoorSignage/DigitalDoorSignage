# DigitalDoorSignage

This project is about a digital door sign (e-paper) that can be used to display who is currently in the classroom and for how long. (this is a vague description since we are still not sure how and what to display)

# Issue Workflow

1. Copy the id of the issue you want to work on
2. Create a new branch with id as name
3. Move the issue to "in progress"
4. Work on issue
5. Push branch
6. Create a pull request on the github website
7. Add a description (I usually just copy every commit message into the description)
8. Move the issue to "to verify"
9. Wait for everyone to review and eventually accept your solution
10. Merge the branch with the "Squash and Merge" option and use the id of the issue as the name
11. Delete the branch online and local
